# Password Strength Checker

This project provides a simple password strength checker using JavaScript and CSS. It dynamically checks the strength of a password as the user types and displays the strength with corresponding colors.

## Files

- `pass.html`: The HTML file to include the JavaScript and CSS.
- `pass.css`: The CSS file for styling the password input field and the strength display.
- `pass.js`: The JavaScript file for creating the input field, checking the password strength, and updating the display.

## Usage

1. **Create `pass.html`:**
    
2. **Create `pass.css`:**
   
3. **Create `pass.js`:**
   
## How It Works

1. **HTML Setup:**
    - `pass.html` includes a reference to the `pass.css` file for styling and the `pass.js` file for functionality.

2. **CSS Styling:**
    - `pass.css` defines styles for the password input field and different classes for the password strength display based on the strength level.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    - `pass.js` creates an input field for the password and a div to display the strength.
    - It includes a function to check the password strength and another to update the display with the corresponding color and text.
    - An event listener is added to the password input field to check the strength and update the display as the user types.

## Example

When you open `pass.html` in a browser, you'll see an input field for the password. As you type, the strength of the password is displayed below with appropriate colors.
